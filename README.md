🛠️🚀 # JavaScript Mini-Projects

As part of my **MERN Stack learning journey**, I have learned **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. To enhance my hands-on experience and build a strong foundation, I decided to work on **mini projects** using these technologies. These projects will help me improve my skills, understand core concepts better, and gain practical experience in **front-end development**.

In a structured way to gain hands-on experience, I started creating and working on **mini projects** that focus on different aspects of JavaScript and web development.

## 📌 Tasks
- [Task 1: Calculator](#task-1-calculator)(#task-1-calculator)
- [Task 2: Password Generator](#task-2-password-generator)(#task-2-password-generator)
- [Task 3: Analog Clock].(#task-3-analog-clock).(#task-3-analog-clock)

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Install **Git** on your PC or laptop from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
2. Open **VS Code** (or any terminal of your choice).
3. Initialize Git in your local directory:
   ```sh
   git init
   ```
4. Clone this repository using the following command:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/javascript-mini-projects.git
   ```
5. Open the desired project folder.
6. Run `index.html` in your browser.


## 🚀 Projects

### 🔢 Task 1: Calculator
A basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

#### Features:
- User-friendly interface with number buttons and operators.
- Performs basic calculations dynamically.
- Displays results instantly.
- Implemented using **DOM manipulation** and **JavaScript event handling**.

#### What I Learned:
- Handling user inputs using JavaScript.
- Manipulating the DOM to update the display.
- Implementing calculation logic and using **string methods**.

### 🔑 Task 2: Password Generator
A tool that generates secure random passwords with customizable length and characters.

#### Features:
- Generates strong and random passwords.
- Allows users to set a fixed password length.
- Provides options to include/exclude uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Allows customization of password length and character types.
- Copy generated password to clipboard with a single click.
- Implemented using **JavaScript random function**, **DOM manipulation**, and **clipboard events**.

#### What I Learned:
- Utilizing the **random function** in JavaScript to generate secure passwords.
- Enhancing **DOM manipulation** for dynamic content updates.
- Implementing **clipboard copy functionality** using JavaScript events.
- Improving user interaction with real-time password generation.
  
### 🕰️ Task 3: Analog Clock

A **real-time analog clock** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project dynamically updates the clock hands based on the current time using JavaScript.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Real-time updates** every second  
✅ **Smooth animations** for hour, minute, and second hands  
✅ **Minimal & modern UI design**  
✅ **Fully responsive** for different screen sizes  
✅ **Dark theme for an elegant look**  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** for structuring the clock interface  
- **CSS** for styling and animations  
- **JavaScript** for fetching the current time and updating the clock hands  


## 📌 How It Works

1. The **JavaScript `Date()` object** fetches the current time.  
2. The **hour, minute, and second hands** are updated dynamically using **CSS transformations**.  
3. The clock refreshes **every second** to reflect real-time movement.  
4. The UI is enhanced with **shadow effects and transparency** for a sleek look.
