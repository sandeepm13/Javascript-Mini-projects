🛠️🚀 # JavaScript Mini-Projects

As part of my **MERN Stack learning journey**, I have learned **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. To enhance my hands-on experience and build a strong foundation, I decided to work on **mini projects** using these technologies. These projects will help me improve my skills, understand core concepts better, and gain practical experience in **front-end development**.

In a structured way to gain hands-on experience, I started creating and working on **mini projects** that focus on different aspects of JavaScript and web development.
